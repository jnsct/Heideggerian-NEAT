# Heidegarian NEAT

A NEAT algorithm trained to solve a simple puzzle room, in order to show the viability of NEAT algorithms as a means of creating more Heideggerian AI. 
This project is largely a response to Hubert L. Dreyfus' paper [_Why Heideggerian AI failed and how fixing it would require making
it more Heideggerian_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2007.10.012). 
The algorithm aims to solve some of the issues discussed in the paper, exhibiting basic forms of ready-to-handedness, absorbed coping, and other Heideggerian concepts.

# Installation

This algorithm only requires numpy and NEAT-Python, which can be installed with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Training parameters can be set in the config-feedforward and heideggerian_neat.py files.

# Problem Definition

The agent must traverse a room by collecting a key, opening a door, then reaching a goal, in that order. 
The room is bisected by a wall, and the door may only be opened after collecting the key. 
Each item may only be interacted with if the agent has chosen to focus on it.
Below an initial state of the problem can be viewed, as generated by the print_board_state function, where the agent is denoted by A, the key by K, the door by D, and the goal by G.
The item of focus is displayed at the top.

```
Item: key
